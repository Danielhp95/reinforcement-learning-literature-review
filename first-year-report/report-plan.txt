Introduction: describes the direction your research is taking and the research questions it adresses.
# Partially use the stuff for EPSRC

Context: to demonstrate sufficient acquaintance with the relevant field to place your research into context.
1 - Summary of the area, in-depth review of key papers
# Lit review itself?
DONE # Link to lit review of paper!!! Alex I love you!

Conclusion:
1 - Summary of contextual background/literature areas require further studying.
# Game theoretic background (mixed strategies, best responses(, More insight into evolutionary computation (idea of archive, hallf of fame, elite) with regards to self-play and more multi agent RL, focused a lot on single agent.
2 - State relevant research methods, technique and theoretical approaches to move research to next step.
# Research method:
# Techniques: 
# Theoretical approaches:
2 - PROGRESS ON relevant research methods, technique and theoretical approaches to move research to next step.
# Research method: Training via simulation 
# Techniques: Reinforcement learning, deep learning and bayesian optimization
# Theoretical approaches: Self play

DONE # Run experiments on self play:
    - Propose framework
    - Replicate other systems using proposed framework
    - Come up with algorithmic idea to fill in a gap
    - Submit this to IJCAI
    - If results are somewhat successful, try them out in CIG competition.
# Continue working on social robotics paper:
    - Continue working on infrastructure
    - Continue working as a paper reader
DONE 1 - Indicate any risks and how to mitigate them
    - Because I am putting a lot of notions together, I am open to criticism by many fields. This can be mitigated with a more thorough studying of the field, RL I know already enough. Evolutionary algorithms I count with Supervisor's knowledge. Game theoretical background I am taking courses to form myself on.
    - Paper rejections can be mitigated with Unity relationships.
DONE 2 - Say that I have plans for considering ethical issues and data management.
