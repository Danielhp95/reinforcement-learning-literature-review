\item OpenAI Gym \citep{Brockman2016}
\item Real time strategy games have always been a famous testbed for many reinforcement learning algorithms. Talk about Broodwar \citep{Broodwar} and sc2le \citep{Vinyals2017} for Starcraft. (Which one was this again?) \citep{Synnaeve2016}. Followed by microRTS \citep{Ontanon2013}, finishing by saying that \citep{Andersen2017} Creates a unifying and highly customizable RTS environment that allows for POMDP with variyng degrees of partial observability. Compare simulation speed.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Real time strategy games are really appealing for reinforcement scenarios because a good agent should be able to perform effective search and meaningful planning, over environments with enormous branching factors \citep{Soemers2014}\citep{Wender2012}. 
    \end{itemize}
\item Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) \citep{Bellemare2015}
\item VizDoom \citep{Kempka2017}
\item Unity ML-agents \citep{UnityMLAgents}. Currently only performance boost of 100x.
\end{itemize}
