Even though Markov Decision Processes are the most famous mathematical structure used to model an environment in reinforcement learning, there are other types of possible models for RL environment which act as extensions to vanilla MDPs. This section concerns itself to defining these extensions, and making links between them. 

%We will use a running example throughout this section to illustrate the differences between the various environment models. This example will be a grid maze featuring a variety of rooms. Featuring a single agent, the MDP's state space $\mathcal{S}$ will be all valid agent positions withing the maze. The action space $\mathcal{A}$ will be a discrete set corresponding to four movement actions: forward, backwards, left and right. \ldots. The reward function will be binary, and return 1 for reaching some goal state $s_g \in \mathcal{S}$ and 0 otherwise. This can be specified as $R_g(s,a,s') = [s' = g]$. (Maybe example won't work). 

This is not an exhaustive list of all possible mathematical models used to represent environments in the RL literature. However, these are some of the most used or fundamental models in the field, on which the majority of the research is conducted, and on top of which most niche extensions are built.

\subsection{Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP)}

As stated in \citep{Barto2003}, in an MDP, only the sequential nature of the decision process is relevant, not the amount of time that passes between decision points. Semi Markov Decision Processes are a generalization of this idea, where the time elapsed in between decision points, also known as decision stages, is taken into account. Every action taken in an SMDP has an assigned delay $\tau$, known as \textit{holding time}. When an action with holding time $\tau$ is decided at time $t$, the agent waits for $\tau$ timesteps before the action is executed and the next decision point is reached. At this decision point, the agent recieves state $s`$ and a cumulative reward which includes the individual reward of all elapsed timesteps, $r = \sum_{l=t}^{t+\tau}r_{t+l}$. The time until the next decision point $\tau$ can only depend on the action $a$ and state $t$ and thus $\tau$ is independent of the history of the environment. SMDPs can also be used for real-valued time systems instead of discretely timed environments. This holding time allows for a gap in time between sensorial input reaching the agent and the agent's action being executed on the environment. % TODO consider adding examples

This type of process is considered Semi Markovian because as the holding time is elapsing, the agent cannot know how the system is evolving. Thus, in order to determine when the next state (decision point) will be reached, it is necessary to know how much time has elapsed, introducing temporal dependency, breaking the Markov property. To iterate on this point, the probability of reaching state state $s_{t+\tau}$ depends only on $s_t$ and action $a_t$ with associated holding time $\tau$. Once the action $a_t$ has been decided, estimating when the agent will recieve state $s_{t+\tau}$ depends on how much time has elapsed since the action $a_t$ was decided.

A Semi Markov Decision Process is defined by a 5-element tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}(\cdot, \cdot | \cdot, \cdot), \mathcal{R}(\cdot, \cdot, \cdot, \cdot), \gamma)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}$ and $\gamma$ express the same concepts as in classical MDPs.
    \item $\mathcal{P}(s', \tau | s, a)$, where $s',s \in \mathcal{S}, \tau \in \mathbb{N}, a \in \mathcal{A}$, is the transition probability function. Which states the probability of transitioning to state $s`$ after a holding time of $\tau$.
    \item $\mathcal{R}(s, a, s', \tau)$, where $s',s \in \mathcal{S}, a \in \mathcal{A}$, is the reward function. It represents the expected reward of deciding on action $a$ on state $s$ with an assigned holding time of $\tau$ timesteps and landing on state $s'$.
\end{itemize}

%TODO Make a graphic comparing an MDP against an SMDP.

A useful properties of SMDPs is that they can be reduced to regular MDPs through the \textit{data-transformation method}~\citep{Piunovskiy2012}. This introduces the possibility of using MDP solving methods to solve SMDPs. SMDPs have recieved a lot of attention in the field hierarchical learning, especially with regards to options~\citep{Sutton1998}.

\subsection{Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)}
In an MDP, the internal representation of the environment is the same representation that the agent receives at every timestep. POMDPs introduce the idea that what the agent observes at every timestep $t$ is only a partial representation $o_t$ of the real environment state $s_t$. This partial observation $o_t$ alone is not enough to reconstruct the real environment state $s_t$, which entails that $o_t \subset s_t$. A Partially Observable Markov Decision process is defined by a 6-element tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}(\cdot | \cdot, \cdot), \mathcal{R}(\cdot, \cdot), \Omega, \mathcal{O}(\cdot | \cdot, \cdot), \gamma)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}$ and $\gamma$ express the same concepts as in classical MDPs.
    \item $\Omega$ is the set of all possible agent observations. Notably $\Omega \subset \mathcal{S}$, meaning that some of the state properties may never be available to the agent.
    \item $\mathcal{O}(o | s, a)$, where $o \in \mathcal{O}, s \in \mathcal{S}, a \in \mathcal{A}$, represents the probability of the agent recieving observation $o$ after executing action $a$ in state $s$. 
\end{itemize}

In an POMDP the goal of the environment is not to find an optimal policy $\pi^*$ which will maximize the expected cumulative reward. This is because the observations that the agent receives as it acts inside of the environment may not be informative enough to allow the agent to learn an optimal policy. Because of this, the goal of the agent becomes to find an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward \textit{conditioned} on the history of observations that the agent has recieved from the environment. The agent samples actions from its policy, which is no longer conditioned on the state of the environment, as the agent does not have access to it, but rather it is conditioned on the sequence of the observations that the agent has obtained so far, $a_t \sim \pi(o_{\leq t})$. This goal is formalized as:

        \begin{equation}
        \pi^{} = \underset{\pi}{\text{max}}\;  \mathbb{E}_{s_0 \sim \rho_0, s \sim \xi, a \sim \pi(\cdot | o_{\leq t})}[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma r_t]
        \end{equation}

A POMDP can be reduced to an MDP iff, for all timesteps $t$ the agent's observation $o_t$ and the environment state $s_t$ are equal $o_t = s_t$.

\subsection{Decentralized Markov Decision Process (dec-MDP)}

A major shortcoming of MDPs is that they assume stationary environments, which by definition entails that the environment does not change over time. This assumption makes MDPs unsuitable for modelling multi-agent environments. Agents must be considered as non-stationary parts of the environment, because their behaviour changes over time through the course of learning.

Dec-POMDPs form a framework for multiagent planning under uncertainty~\citep{Oliehoek2014}. This uncertainy comes from two sources. The first one being the partial observability of the environment, the second one stemming from the uncertainy that each agent has over the other agent's policies. It is the natural multi-agent generalization of POMDPs, introducing multi-agent concepts from game theory. They are considereded \textit{decentralized} because there is no explicit communication between agents. Agents do not have the explicit ability of sharing their observations and action choices with each other. Every agent bases its decision purely on its individual observations. On every timestep each agent chooses an action simultaneously and they are all collectively submitted to the environment. It is important to note that all agents share the same reward function, making the nature of dec-POMDPs collaborative. A decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process is defined by an 8-element tuple $(I, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}_{1..k}, \mathcal{P}(\cdot | \cdot, \cdot), \mathcal{R}(\cdot, \cdot), \Omega_{1..k}, \mathcal{O(\cdot | \cdot, \cdot)}, H)$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathcal{S}$ and express the same concepts as in classical MDPs.
        \item $I$ is the set of all agent policies present in the dec-POMDP, indexed $1..k$. As stated in Section~\ref{section:markov-decision-processes}, agent's are fully defined by their policies.
        \item $\mathcal{A}_{1..k}$ is a collection of action sets, on for each agent in the environment, with $\mathcal{A}_i$ corresponding to the action set of the $i$th agent.
        \item $\mathcal{P}(s' | s, \mathbf{a})$, where $s \in \mathcal{S}$, $\mathbf{a} = \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal{A}_k$, represents the probability transition function. It states the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ after executing the \textit{joint} action $\mathbf{a}$. The joint action is a vector containing the action performed by every agent at a certain timestep.
        \item $\mathcal{R}(s, \mathbf{a})$, where $s \in \mathcal{S}$, $\mathbf{a} = \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal{A}_k$, represents the reward function associated to the $i$th agent, indicating the reward that the $i$th agent will obtain after the joint action vector $\mathbf{a}$ is executed in state $s$.
        \item $\Omega_{1..k}$ represents the joint set of all agent observations, with $\Omega_i$ representing the set of all possible observations for the $i$th agent.
        \item $\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{o} | s, \mathbf{a})$, where $\mathbf{o} = \{o_1,\ldots,o_k\}$, $o_1 \in \Omega_1, \ldots, o_k \in \Omega_k$, $s \in \mathcal{S}$, $\mathbf{a} = \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal{A}_k$, represents the probability of observing the joint observation vector $\mathbf{o}$, containing an observation for each agent, after executing the joint action $\mathbf{a}$ in state $s$.
        \item $H \in \mathbb{N}$ represents the finite time horizon, the number of steps over which the agents will try to maximize their cummulative reward.
    \end{itemize}

    A dec-POMDP featuring a single agent, $|I| = 1$, can be treated as a POMDP\@. Furthermore, when agents are permitted to have different reward functions, this model becomes a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG)~\citep{Hansen2004}.

\subsection{Markov Game}

~\cite{Owen1982} first introduced the notion of a Markov Game. Markov Games also serve to model multi-agent environments. They came to be as a crossbreed between game theoretic structures such as extended-form games and Markov Decision Processes. 
A Markov Game with $k$ different agents is denoted by a 5-element tuple $(\mathcal{S}, {\mathcal{A}_{1..k}}, \mathcal{P}(\cdot | \cdot, \cdot), {\mathcal{R}_{1..k}(\cdot, \cdot)}, \gamma)$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{S}$ and $\gamma$ express the same concepts as classical MDPs.
    \item $\mathcal{A}_{1..k}$ is a collection of action sets, on for each agent in the environment, with $\mathcal{A}_i$ corresponding to the action set of the $i$th agent.
    \item $\mathcal{P}(s' | s, \mathbf{a})$, where $s \in \mathcal{S}$, $\mathbf{a} = \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal{A}_k$, represents probability transition function. It states the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ after executing the \textit{joint} action $\mathbf{a}$. The joint action represents all of the actions that were executed at timestep $t$.
    \item $\mathcal{R}_i(s, \mathbf{a})$, where $s \in \mathcal{S}$, $\mathbf{a} = \{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ and $a_1 \in \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal{A}_k$, represents the reward function associated to the $i$th agent, indicating the reward that the $i$th agent will obtain after the joint action $\mathbf{a}$ is executed in state $s$.
\end{itemize}

Each agent independently tries to maximize its expected discounted cumulative reward, $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{j} r_{i,t+j}]$, where $r_{i, t+j}$ is the reward obtained by agent $i$ at time $t+j$.

Markov Games have several important properties~\cite{Owen1982, Littman1994}. Like MDP's, Every Markov game features an optimal policy for each agent. Unlike MDPs, these policies may be \textit{stochastic}. The need for stochastic action choice stems from the agent's uncertainty about the opponent's pending moves. On top of this, sthocastic policies make it difficult for opponents to ``second guess'' the agent's action, which makes the policy less exploitable. 

When the number of agents in a Markov Game is exactly 1, the Markov Game can be considered an MDP\@. When $|\mathcal{S}| = 1$, the environment can be considered a normal-form game from game theory literature. TALK ABOUT GAMA BEING THE PROBABILITY OF ENDING THE EPISODE AND THE KEY DIFFERENCE AGAINST DEC-pomdpS THAT WE HAVE PER AGENT REWARD FUNCTIONS.
