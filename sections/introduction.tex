Reinforcement learning (RL) is an optimization framework. A problem can be considered a reinforcement learning problem if it can be framed in the following way: Given an enviroment in which an agent can take actions, receiving a reward for each action, find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward that the agent will obtain by acting in the environment.
