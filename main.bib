abstract = {In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions. The deterministic pol- icy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value func- tion. This simple form means that the deter- ministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic pol- icy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counter- parts in high-dimensional action spaces.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning agents are adaptive, reactive, and self-supervised. The aim of this dissertation is to extend the state of the art of reinforcement learning and enable its applications to complex robot-learning problems. In particular, it focuses on two issues. First, learning from sparse and delayed reinforcement signals is hard and in general a slow process. Techniques for reducing learning time must be devised. Second, most existing reinforcement learning methods assume that the world is a Markov decision process. This assumption is too strong for many robot tasks of interest.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis dissertation demonstrates how we can possibly overcome the slow learning problem and tackle non-Markovian environments, making reinforcement learning more practical for realistic robot tasks: (1) Reinforcement learning can be naturally integrated with artificial neural networks to obtain high-quality generalization, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Neural networks are used in this dissertation, and they generalize effectively even in the presence of noise and a large of binary and real-valued inputs. (2) Reinforcement learning agents can save many learning trials by using an action model, which can be learned on-line. With a model, an agent can mentally experience the effects of its actions without actually executing them. Experience replay is a simple technique that implements this idea, and is shown to be effective in reducing the number of action executions required. (3) Reinforcement learning agents can take advantage of instructive training instances provided by human teachers, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Teaching can also help learning agents avoid local optima during the search for optimal control. Simulation experiments indicate that even a small amount of teaching can save agents many learning trials. (4) Reinforcement learning agents can significantly reduce learning time by hierarchical learning--they first solve elementary learning problems and then combine solutions to the elementary problems to solve a complex problem. Simulation experiments indicate that a robot with hierarchical learning can solve a complex problem, which otherwise is hardly solvable within a reasonable time. (5) Reinforcement learning agents can deal with a wide range of non-Markovian environments by having a memory of their past. Three memory architectures are discussed. They work reasonably well for a variety of simple problems. One of them is also successfully applied to a nontrivial non-Markovian robot task.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe results of this dissertation rely on computer simulation, including (1) an agent operating in a dynamic and hostile environment and (2) a mobile robot operating in a noisy and non-Markovian environment. The robot simulator is physically realistic. This dissertation concludes that it is possible to build artificial agents than can acquire complex control policies effectively by reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Gradient-based approaches to direct policy search in reinforcement learning have received much recent attention as a means to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of the problems associated with policy degradation in value-function methods. In this paper we introduce GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes POMDPs controlled by parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by (Kimura et al. 1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters, uses one free beta (which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to controlled Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order derivatives, and a version for training stochastic policies with internal states. In a companion paper (Baxter et al., this volume) we show how the gradient estimates generated by GPOMDP can be used in both a traditional stochastic gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.},

Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.},

This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.},

abstract = {Q-learning (QL) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to op-timal policies in Markov decision processes. However, QL exhibits an artifact: in expectation, the effective rate of updating the value of an action depends on the probability of choosing that action. In other words, there is a tight coupling between the learning dynamics and underlying execution policy. This coupling can cause performance degradation in noisy non-stationary environments. Here, we introduce Repeated Update Q-learning (RUQL), a learning algorithm that resolves the undesirable artifact of Q-learning while maintaining simplicity. We analyze the similarities and differences between RUQL, QL, and the closest state-of-the-art algorithms theoretically. Our analysis shows that RUQL maintains the convergence guarantee of QL in stationary environments, while relaxing the coupling between the execution policy and the learning dynamics. Experimental results confirm the theoretical insights and show how RUQL outperforms both QL and the closest state-of-the-art algorithms in noisy non-stationary environments.},

This paper evaluates four different exploration strategies com-bined with Q-learning using random stochastic mazes to inves-tigate their performances. We will compare: UCB-1, softmax, -greedy, and pursuit. For this purpose we adapted the UCB-1 and pursuit strategies to be used in the Q-learning algorithm. The mazes consist of a single optimal goal state and two suboptimal goal states that lie closer to the starting position of the agent, which makes efficient exploration an important part of the learning agent. Furthermore, we evaluate two different kinds of reward functions, a normalized one with rewards between 0 and 1, and an unnormalized reward function that penalizes the agent for each step with a negative reward. We have performed an extensive grid-search to find the best parameters for each method and used the best parameters on novel randomly generated maze problems of different sizes. The results show that softmax exploration outperforms the other strategies, although it is harder to tune its temperature parameter. The worst performing exploration strategy is -greedy.},

abstract = {Multi-agent learning is a crucial method to control or find solutions for systems, in which more than one entity needs to be adaptive. In todays interconnected world, such sys- tems are ubiquitous in many domains, including auctions in economics, swarm robotics in computer science, and politics in social sciences. Multi-agent learning is inherently more complex than single-agent learning and has a relatively thin theoretical framework supporting it. Recently, multi-agent learning dynamics have been linked to evolutionary game theory, allowing the interpretation of learning as an evolu- tion of competing policies in the mind of the learning agents. The dynamical system from evolutionary game theory that has been linked to Q-learning predicts the expected behav- ior of the learning agents. Closer analysis however allows for two interesting observations: the predicted behavior is not always the same as the actual behavior, and in case of deviation, the predicted behavior is more desirable. This discrepancy is elucidated in this article, and based on these new insights Frequency Adjusted Q- (FAQ-) learning is pro- posed. This variation of Q-learning perfectly adheres to the predictions of the evolutionary model for an arbitrarily large part of the policy space. In addition to the theoretical dis- cussion, experiments in the three classes of two-agent two- action games illustrate the superiority of FAQ-learning.},

We model such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system that utilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towards specifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowl-edge sharing between constraints and features (basis func-tions) for function approximation. Results on a soccer game and a tactical real-time strategy game show that coordi-nation constraints improve the learning rate compared to using only unary constraints.

Little, however, is understood about the theoretical properties of such combinations, and many researchers have encountered failures in practice. In this paper we identify a prime source of such failures—namely, a systematic overestimation of utility values. Using Watkins' Q-Learning [18] as an example, we give a theoretical account of the phenomenon, deriving conditions under which one may expected it to cause learning to fail.

In this paper, we consider variance reduction methods that were developed for Monte Carlo estimates of integrals. We study two commonly used policy gradient techniques, the baseline and actor-critic methods, from this perspective. Both can be interpreted as additive control variate variance reduction methods. We consider the expected average reward performance measure, and we focus on the GPOMDP algorithm for estimating performance gradients in partially observable Markov decision processes controlled by stochastic reactive policies. We give bounds for the estimation error of the gradient estimates for both baseline and actor-critic algorithms, in terms of the sample size and mixing properties of the controlled system. For the baseline technique, we compute the optimal baseline, and show that the popular approach of using the average reward to define the baseline can be suboptimal. For actor-critic algorithms, we show that using the true value function as the critic can be suboptimal. We also discuss algorithms for estimating the optimal baseline and approximate value function.},

Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

abstract = {We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

@article{Pathak2017,
abstract = {In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.

@article{Deasis2017,
abstract = {Unifying seemingly disparate algorithmic ideas to produce better performing algorithms has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. As a primary example, TD($\lambda$) elegantly unifies one-step TD prediction with Monte Carlo meth-ods through the use of eligibility traces and the trace-decay parameter $\lambda$. Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be used to per-form TD control, including Sarsa, Q-learning, and Expected Sarsa. These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be ex-tended across multiple time steps to achieve bet-ter performance. Each of these algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the oth-ers for all problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm called Q($\sigma$) which unifies and generalizes these exist-ing algorithms, while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, $\sigma$, is introduced to al-low the degree of sampling performed by the al-gorithm at each step during its backup to be con-tinuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one ex-treme (full sampling), and Expected Sarsa exist-ing at the other (pure expectation). Q($\sigma$) is gen-erally applicable to both on-and off-policy learn-ing, but in this work we focus on experiments in the on-policy case. Our results show that an in-termediate value of $\sigma$, which results in a mixture of the existing algorithms, performs better than either extreme. The mixture can also be varied dynamically which can result in even greater per-formance.},
