abstract = {Q-learning (QL) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to op-timal policies in Markov decision processes. However, QL exhibits an artifact: in expectation, the effective rate of updating the value of an action depends on the probability of choosing that action. In other words, there is a tight coupling between the learning dynamics and underlying execution policy. This coupling can cause performance degradation in noisy non-stationary environments. Here, we introduce Repeated Update Q-learning (RUQL), a learning algorithm that resolves the undesirable artifact of Q-learning while maintaining simplicity. We analyze the similarities and differences between RUQL, QL, and the closest state-of-the-art algorithms theoretically. Our analysis shows that RUQL maintains the convergence guarantee of QL in stationary environments, while relaxing the coupling between the execution policy and the learning dynamics. Experimental results confirm the theoretical insights and show how RUQL outperforms both QL and the closest state-of-the-art algorithms in noisy non-stationary environments.},

Learning methods are used in Dyna both for compiling planning results and for updating a model of the effects of the agent's actions on the world. Planning is incremental and can use the probabilistic and ofttimes incorrect world models generated by learning processes. Execution is fully reactive in the sense that no planning intervenes between perception and action. Dyna relies on machine learning methods for learning from examples---these are among the basic building blocks making up the architecture---yet is not tied to any particular method.

This paper evaluates four different exploration strategies com-bined with Q-learning using random stochastic mazes to inves-tigate their performances. We will compare: UCB-1, softmax, -greedy, and pursuit. For this purpose we adapted the UCB-1 and pursuit strategies to be used in the Q-learning algorithm. The mazes consist of a single optimal goal state and two suboptimal goal states that lie closer to the starting position of the agent, which makes efficient exploration an important part of the learning agent. Furthermore, we evaluate two different kinds of reward functions, a normalized one with rewards between 0 and 1, and an unnormalized reward function that penalizes the agent for each step with a negative reward. We have performed an extensive grid-search to find the best parameters for each method and used the best parameters on novel randomly generated maze problems of different sizes. The results show that softmax exploration outperforms the other strategies, although it is harder to tune its temperature parameter. The worst performing exploration strategy is -greedy.},

abstract = {Multi-agent learning is a crucial method to control or find solutions for systems, in which more than one entity needs to be adaptive. In todays interconnected world, such sys- tems are ubiquitous in many domains, including auctions in economics, swarm robotics in computer science, and politics in social sciences. Multi-agent learning is inherently more complex than single-agent learning and has a relatively thin theoretical framework supporting it. Recently, multi-agent learning dynamics have been linked to evolutionary game theory, allowing the interpretation of learning as an evolu- tion of competing policies in the mind of the learning agents. The dynamical system from evolutionary game theory that has been linked to Q-learning predicts the expected behav- ior of the learning agents. Closer analysis however allows for two interesting observations: the predicted behavior is not always the same as the actual behavior, and in case of deviation, the predicted behavior is more desirable. This discrepancy is elucidated in this article, and based on these new insights Frequency Adjusted Q- (FAQ-) learning is pro- posed. This variation of Q-learning perfectly adheres to the predictions of the evolutionary model for an arbitrarily large part of the policy space. In addition to the theoretical dis- cussion, experiments in the three classes of two-agent two- action games illustrate the superiority of FAQ-learning.},

We model such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system that utilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towards specifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowl-edge sharing between constraints and features (basis func-tions) for function approximation.

Little, however, is understood about the theoretical properties of such combinations, and many researchers have encountered failures in practice. In this paper we identify a prime source of such failures—namely, a systematic overestimation of utility values. Using Watkins' Q-Learning [18] as an example, we give a theoretical account of the phenomenon, deriving conditions under which one may expected it to cause learning to fail.

However, the variance of the performance gradient estimates obtained from the simulation is sometimes excessive. In this paper, we consider variance reduction methods that were developed for Monte Carlo estimates of integrals. We study two commonly used policy gradient techniques, the baseline and actor-critic methods, from this perspective. Both can be interpreted as additive control variate variance reduction methods. We consider the expected average reward performance measure, and we focus on the GPOMDP algorithm for estimating performance gradients in partially observable Markov decision processes controlled by stochastic reactive policies. We give bounds for the estimation error of the gradient estimates for both baseline and actor-critic algorithms, in terms of the sample size and mixing properties of the controlled system. For the baseline technique, we compute the optimal baseline, and show that the popular approach of using the average reward to define the baseline can be suboptimal. For actor-critic algorithms, we show that using the true value function as the critic can be suboptimal. We also discuss algorithms for estimating the optimal baseline and approximate value function.},

In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning is poised to revolutionise the field of AI and represents a step towards building autonomous systems with a higher level understanding of the visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep {\$}Q{\$}-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.},

@article{Jaderberg2016a,
abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local infor- mation. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

@article{Czarnecki2017,
abstract = {When training neural networks, the use of Synthetic Gradients (SG) allows layers or modules to be trained without update locking - without waiting for a true error gradient to be backpropagated - resulting in Decoupled Neural Interfaces (DNIs). This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a neural network asynchronously and with only local information was demonstrated to work empirically in Jaderberg et al (2016). However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence of the learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems we investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different layer-wise representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying language for discussion and comparison.},

abstract = {Unifying seemingly disparate algorithmic ideas to produce better performing algorithms has been a longstanding goal in reinforcement learning. As a primary example, TD($\lambda$) elegantly unifies one-step TD prediction with Monte Carlo meth-ods through the use of eligibility traces and the trace-decay parameter $\lambda$. Currently, there are a multitude of algorithms that can be used to per-form TD control, including Sarsa, Q-learning, and Expected Sarsa. These methods are often studied in the one-step case, but they can be ex-tended across multiple time steps to achieve bet-ter performance. Each of these algorithms is seemingly distinct, and no one dominates the oth-ers for all problems. In this paper, we study a new multi-step action-value algorithm called Q($\sigma$) which unifies and generalizes these exist-ing algorithms, while subsuming them as special cases. A new parameter, $\sigma$, is introduced to al-low the degree of sampling performed by the al-gorithm at each step during its backup to be con-tinuously varied, with Sarsa existing at one ex-treme (full sampling), and Expected Sarsa exist-ing at the other (pure expectation). Q($\sigma$) is gen-erally applicable to both on-and off-policy learn-ing, but in this work we focus on experiments in the on-policy case. Our results show that an in-termediate value of $\sigma$, which results in a mixture of the existing algorithms, performs better than either extreme. The mixture can also be varied dynamically which can result in even greater per-formance.},

@article{Ricciardi2008,
abstract = {Traditionally, AI research for games has focused on developing static strategies—fixed maps from the game state to a set of actions—which maximize the probability of victory. This works well for discovering facts about the game itself, and can be very successfully applied to combinatorial games like chess and checkers, where the personality and play style of the opponent takes a backseat to the mathematical problem of the game. In addition, this is the most widely used sort of AI among commercial video games today [1]. While these algorithms can often fight effectively, they tend to become repetitive and transparent to the players of the game, because their strategies are fixed. Even the most advanced AI algorithms for complex games often have a hole in their programming, a simple strategy which can be repeated over and over to remove the challenge of the AI opponent. Because their algorithms are static and inflexible, these AIs are incapable of adapting to these strategies and restoring the balance of the game. In addition, many games simply do not take well to these sorts of algorithms. Fighting games, such as Street Fighter and Virtua Fighter, often have no objectively correct move in any given situation. Rather, any of the available moves could be good or bad, depending on the opponent's reaction. These games reward intuition, good guessing, and the ability to get into your opponent's mind, rather than mastery of abstract game concepts. Hence, the static AI algorithms that are most prevalent tend to do even worse in these games than in others. These two problems are perfect for applying the techniques of machine learning. A better AI would have to be able to adapt to the player and model his or her actions, in order to predict and react to them. In this paper, we discuss how we developed such an AI and tested its effectiveness in a fighting game.},

We model the probability of winning a point on service and show that points are neither independent nor identically distributed: winning the previous point has a positive ef- fect on winning the current point, and at ‘important' points it is more difficult for the server to win the point than at less important points. Furthermore, the weaker a player, the stronger are these effects. De- viations from iid are, however, small and hence the iid hypothesis will still provide a good approximation in many cases. The results are based on a large panel of matches played atWimbledon 1992—1995, in total almost 90,000 points.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. The probability of winning a game, set, match, or single elimination tournament in tennis is computed using Monte Carlo simulations based on each player's probability of winning a point on serve, which can be held constant or varied from point to point, game to game, or match to match. The theory, described in Newton and Keller [Stud. Appl. Math., 114 (2005), pp. 241-269], is based on the assumption that points in tennis are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. This is used as a baseline to compare with the simulations, which under similar circumstances are shown to converge quickly to the analytical curves in accordance with the weak law of large numbers. The concept of the importance of a point, game, and set to winning a match is described based on conditional probabilities and is used as a starting point to model non-i.i.d. effects, allowing each player to vary, from point to point, his or her probability of winning on serve. Several non-i.i.d. models are investigated, including the "hot-hand-effect," in which we increase each player's probability of winning a point on serve on the next point after a point is won. The "back to-the-wall" effect is modeled by increasing each player's probability of winning a point on serve on the next point after a point is lost. In all cases, we find that the results provided by the theoretical curves based on the i.i.d. assumption are remarkably robust and accurate, even when relatively strong non-i.i.d. effects are introduced. We end by showing examples of tournament predictions from the 2002 men's and women's U.S. Open draws based on the Monte Carlo simulations. We also describe Arrow's impossibility theorem and discuss its relevance with regard to sports ranking systems, and we argue for the development of probability-based ranking systems as a way to soften its consequences.},

@article{Lindley2008,
abstract = {Schema theory provides a foundation for the analysis of game play patterns created by players during their interaction with a game. Schema models derived from the analysis of play provide a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of levels of attentional demand in schema execution. However, schemas may not only be used to describe play, but might be used actively as cognitive models within a game engine. Predesigned schema models are knowledge representations constituting anticipated or desired learned cognitive outcomes of play. Automated analysis of player schemas and comparison with predesigned target schemas can provide a foundation for a game engine adapting or tuning game mechanics to achieve specific effects of engagement, immersion, and cognitive skill acquisition by players. Hence, schema models may enhance the play experience as well as provide a foundation for achieving explicitly represented pedagogical or therapeutic functions of games.},

abstract = {Game generation systems perform automated, intelligent design of games (i.e. videogames, boardgames), reasoning about both the abstract rule system of the game and the visual realization of these rules. Although, as an instance of the problem of creative design, game generation shares some common research themes with other creative AI systems such as story and art generators, game generation extends such work by having to reason about dynamic, playable artifacts. Like AI work on creativity in other domains, work on game generation sheds light on the human game design process, offering opportunities to make explicit the tacit knowledge involved in game design and test game design theories. Finally, game generation enables new game genres which are radically customized to specific players or situations; notable examples are cell phone games customized for particular users and newsgames providing commentary on current events. We describe an approach to formalizing game mechanics and generating games using those mechanics, using WordNet and ConceptNet to assist in performing common-sense reasoning about game verbs and nouns. Finally, we demonstrate and describe in detail a prototype that designs micro-games in the style of Nintendo's WarioWare series.},

abstract = {Game designs often center on the game mechanics—rules governing the logical evolution of the game. We seek to de- velop an intelligent system that generates computer games and assists humans in designing games. As first steps to- wards this goal we present a composable and cross-domain representation for game mechanics that draws from AI plan- ning action representations. We use a constraint solver to generate mechanics subject to design requirements on the form of those mechanics—what they do in the game. A planner takes a set of generated mechanics and tests whether those mechanics meet playability requirements—controlling how mechanics function in a game to affect player behav- ior. We demonstrate our system by modeling and generat- ing mechanics in a role-playing game, platformer game, and combined role-playing-platformer game.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},
